# Backend Implementation Updates Summary

## Changes Made for Local Single-User Deployment

### 1. **Supabase Storage (Story 20)**
- ✅ Noted that signed upload URLs expire after 2 hours (non-configurable)
- ✅ Added recommendation to use public bucket for simplicity in local setup
- ✅ Added base64 image support as alternative to URL uploads

### 2. **OpenRouter API (Story 22)**
- ✅ Added support for base64-encoded images alongside URLs
- ✅ Corrected model naming format (must use "provider/model-name" format)
- ✅ Added provider routing configuration (disabled fallbacks for predictable testing)
- ✅ Added proper async/await implementation example with retry logic
- ✅ Added handling for 429 rate limits with retry-after header

### 3. **FastAPI Configuration (Story 25)**
- ✅ Enhanced CORS configuration with `expose_headers=["*"]`
- ✅ Added support for multiple localhost ports (5173, 5174)
- ✅ Simplified error handling for single-user context

### 4. **Backend Implementation Plan**
- ✅ Updated to use Pydantic V2 syntax with ConfigDict
- ✅ Added proper database indexes for performance
- ✅ Simplified architecture removing unnecessary features:
  - No WebSocket (polling is fine for single user)
  - No rate limiting (single user doesn't need this)
  - No caching (low volume for single user)
  - Basic console logging (no complex monitoring)
- ✅ Added Python dependencies list
- ✅ Updated async patterns using httpx.AsyncClient

### 5. **Key Technical Updates**
- **Model Names**: Always use exact OpenRouter format (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o", not "gpt-4o")
- **Image Handling**: Support both URLs and base64 encoding
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of OpenRouter-specific errors (429, 401, 400)
- **Async Patterns**: Proper use of asyncio.Semaphore and httpx.AsyncClient
- **CORS**: Full configuration for local development

## Removed Features (Not Needed for Single Local User)
- ❌ WebSocket real-time updates
- ❌ Complex caching mechanisms
- ❌ Rate limiting middleware
- ❌ Comprehensive monitoring/logging
- ❌ Multiple authentication methods
- ❌ Complex health check endpoints

## Quick Start Dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi==0.115.0 uvicorn[standard] pydantic==2.0 supabase==2.0 httpx python-multipart python-dotenv
```

## Environment Variables
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
MAX_CONCURRENCY=5
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174
```

## Notes
- All changes optimize for local single-user deployment
- Simplified architecture reduces complexity while maintaining robustness
- Base64 image support makes local testing easier without storage setup
- Provider routing disabled for predictable local testing
