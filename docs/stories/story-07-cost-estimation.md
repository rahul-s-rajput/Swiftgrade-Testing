# Story 7: Cost Estimation

## Context and Goals
Cost estimation is out-of-scope for the prototype. Focus remains on selecting models and assigning simple reasoning levels.

- Source: This doc. Component: `src/components/MultiSelect.tsx`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] None for prototype.

## Prototype Notes
- Future direction: a separate page/section could compute estimated monthly costs given a per-model usage input. Not needed now.

## Definition of Done
- This story is marked as deferred; no implementation required.
