# Story 14: Documentation

## Context and Goals
Provide complete documentation so others can use and maintain the picker.

- Source: Technical Debt (Story 14), Quick Start (guide), Implementation Plan (Component Structure, API Examples).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API documentation for props and types.
- [ ] Usage examples with code snippets.
- [ ] Prop descriptions and defaults.
- [ ] Architecture diagram of components/hooks.
- [ ] Contribution guide (dev, testing, PRs).
- [ ] Storybook stories for components (optional in initial pass).

## Implementation Plan
- __Docs__: Extend `docs/` with `OpenRouter Model Picker` section; keep these story files as canonical spec.
- __JSDoc/TSdoc__: Add comments to exported types and props.
- __Examples__: Update example usage and README snippet.
- __Diagrams__: Simple mermaid or draw.io in `docs/`.

## Definition of Done
- Docs synced with actual API surface.
- Examples run without errors.
