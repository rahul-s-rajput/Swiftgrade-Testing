# Story 10: Performance Optimization

## Context and Goals
Keep UI responsive with large model catalogs.

- Source: User Stories (Story 10), Implementation Plan (Performance Optimizations), Quick Start hints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for model list.
- [ ] Lazy load model images (if any) and heavy details.
- [ ] Debounced filtering.
- [ ] Memoized computations.
- [ ] Progressive enhancement.
- [ ] < 100ms interaction response.
- [ ] < 2s initial load time (network permitting; measure from first byte).

## Implementation Plan
- __Virtualization__: Integrate `react-virtual` or similar for grid/list.
- __Memoization__: `useMemo`, `React.memo` for ModelCard and filtered lists.
- __Lazy details__: Expandable data fetched/rendered on demand.
- __Metrics__: Simple performance marks with `performance.now()` and logging in dev.

## Testing Scenarios
- 500+ models remain smooth.
- Filtering still instant with debounce.

## Definition of Done
- Measurable improvements, verified in dev with mock data volume.
